      "traditional artisans and craftspeople, who work with their hands \n",
      "using tools, have brought renown for India. They are generally \n",
      "referred to as Vishwakarma. The art and handicraft created by them \n",
      "represents the true spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat. For the first time, a \n",

      "146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to  \n",
      "` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I \n",
      "propose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, \n",
      "persons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to \n",
      "pay any tax.  \n",
      "147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals. \n",
      " I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime \n",
      "with six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax \n",
      "structure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and \n",
      "increasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are: \n",
      "` 0-3 lakh Nil \n",

      "individual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  \n",
      "` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 \n",

      "an individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only  \n",
      "` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent \n",

      "including family pensioners, for whom I propose to extend the benefit of 34 \n",

      " \n",

      "income of ` 15.5 lakh or more will thus stand to benefit by ` 52,500. \n",
      "150. My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the \n",
      "highest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the \n",
      "highest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 \n",
      "per cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction \n",
      "of the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. \n",
      "151. Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment \n",
      "on retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the \n",
      "year 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- \n",
      "pm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to \n",

      "regime. However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the \n",
      "benefit of the old tax regime. \n",
      "153. Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in \n",
      "the annexure. \n",
